# Pokémon Web Application

This repository contains a web application that allows users to explore Pokémon details, catch them, and mark them as caught or released.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project was to create a user-friendly Pokémon exploration and catching web application. The application fetches Pokémon data from the [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) and displays it to users. Users can catch Pokémon, mark them as caught, release them, and explore various details about each Pokémon.

## Features

- **Pokémon List:** Display a list of Pokémon with their images, names, and IDs.
- **Pokémon Details Modal:** View detailed information about a specific Pokémon in a modal, including its height, weight, abilities, and base stats.
- **Catching Pokémon:** Users can catch Pokémon using the "Catch Pokémon" button in the modal.
- **Marking Caught Pokémon:** After catching a Pokémon, users can mark it as caught, changing the button to "Caught!".
- **Releasing Pokémon:** Users can release a caught Pokémon using the "Release" button, changing the button back to "Catch Pokémon".
- **Load More:** Fetch and display more Pokémon when clicking the "Load More" button.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/): Used for styling and responsiveness.
- [jQuery](https://jquery.com/): Used for DOM manipulation and AJAX requests.
- [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/): Used for fetching Pokémon data.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into several components:

- **index.html:** The main HTML file containing the structure of the web page.
- **styles.css:** The stylesheet file containing custom styles for the application.
- **script.js:** The JavaScript file containing the logic for fetching and displaying Pokémon data, handling catching and releasing, and managing the modal.

## Challenges Faced

- **Styling the Modal:** Achieving a visually appealing and responsive modal for displaying Pokémon details required adjusting styles and ensuring proper centering of content.
- **Catching and Releasing Logic:** Implementing the logic for catching and releasing Pokémon, as well as updating the UI dynamically based on the Pokémon's status, posed challenges that required careful handling of events and state.
-  **Displaying Caught Pokémon:** Implementing the feature to display the list of caught Pokémon when clicking on the dropdown menu and then selecting "Caught" required additional logic and event handling.

## Resources Used

- [Bootstrap Documentation](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/getting-started/introduction/): Referenced for styling and layout.
- [jQuery Documentation](https://api.jquery.com/): Referenced for DOM manipulation and AJAX requests.
- [PokeAPI Documentation](https://pokeapi.co/docs/v2): Used for understanding how to fetch Pokémon data.


## Conclusion

This project has been a valuable learning experience, involving tasks such as working with APIs, managing dynamic content, and handling user interactions. While it lays the groundwork for future improvements and features, I acknowledge that there are still challenges that I am actively addressing. Despite these challenges, I am committed to putting in my best effort to ensure that the website meets the specified requirements.
